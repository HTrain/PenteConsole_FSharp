# PenteConsole_FSharp
Console F# version of Pente, the classic game of strategy

My first exploration of functional programming, the rules of Pente are implemented in F# with a simple console based UI.

I plan to use this game logic to create a web based version that uses a REST API for game processing and history with a disconnected client side UI.
